# Lets take one list
obj = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Iterate this list in java we use for(int i=0; i<5; i++) in python we for i in obj
# instead of { } we use to : in to tell program
for i in obj:
    print(i)
    print(i*2)

# In python how  u set limit lke java u say i < 5 so how u say python that u want condition with loop (0, 5)
# You can give default for j in range (10) then by default loop start from 0
for j in range(1, 6):
    print(j)

sum = 0
for k in range(1, 6,):
    sum = sum + k
print(sum)

# Now in Java i++ let check in python
for x in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(x)

# m in range (10)
for m in range(10):
    print(m)
